# AI-Based Smart Water Usage Advisor for Sustainable Communities

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing historical water usage data and predicting future water consumption using Artificial Intelligence. The goal of the project is to support sustainable water management by identifying usage trends and reducing water wastage.

## Problem Statement
Water scarcity is increasing due to inefficient usage and lack of proper monitoring. Many communities do not analyze water consumption data regularly, which leads to wastage and poor planning. This project uses AI to analyze past water usage data and predict future demand to support sustainable decision-making.

## AI Solution
The solution uses Machine Learning, specifically Linear Regression, to analyze historical water usage data. The model identifies patterns in the data and predicts future water consumption. Visualizations are used to clearly present the results and trends.

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Machine Learning (Linear Regression)  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook  

## SDG Alignment
- SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation  
- SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities  
- SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production  

## Impact
This project helps users understand water usage patterns, reduce wastage, and improve planning for sustainable water resource management.
